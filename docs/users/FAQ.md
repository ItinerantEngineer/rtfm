# FAQ

## What is SYN Shop?

SYN Shop is a "hackerspace(external link)" located in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is a space for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, learning. Our motto is: "Let's make stuff awesome!"

The group tends to be focused on electronics. However, many members do metal working, programming, wood working, crafting, and a variety of other things. Synshop provides a fertile environment and community that is passionate about learning, helping others, and growing the community of hackers/makers/tinkerers/geeks in Las Vegas. We also like to meet people from other hackerspaces, and have seen people visit SYN Shop from hackerspaces world wide.

Mondays and Wednesdays are themed after interest groups. If you come to work, your project does not have to match the theme. However these nights tend to attract members of the community that are interested in that theme. DIY Robot Domination attracts robotics enthusiasts. Craft Night attracts "Team Low Tech" and all others who are interested in a variety of general crafts. Think of a knitting circle where one person knits, one person builds models, and another sews a quilt.
