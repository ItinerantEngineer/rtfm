# Access Control System

## Project Goal

Setup access control system for SYN Shop that handles RFID access to the shop, as well as integrates security monitoring.

Initially the system will provide badge access to the front and back doors. Additionally an alarm system will have motion sensors, door sensors, and a glass shatter sensor. System will eventually be integrated with a camera system, but that will be handled as a different project.

## Build out

* All low voltage wiring will be run surface mount to save on the cost of installing conduit initally.
* Front door pushbar needs to be modified to install a solenoid to allow integration with the access control system.
* Open Access Control kit needs to be assembled.
* Internet access at the shop needs to be established in order to send notifications.
