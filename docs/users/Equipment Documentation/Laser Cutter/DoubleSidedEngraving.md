# Double Sided Laser Engraving

Remember the cardinal rule of RetinaEngrave.  The internet will tell you you can make a design on separate layers of a graphics file, and print them separately into RE and they will line up.  The internet lies, or, SynShop's version of the software is not that version.  

* You need two wholly separate files
* The only way to make them line up is to put a big black registration square in the upper left, above your design.  I think I had to go up to 6mm a side to get RE to recognize it
* Cut, then flip.  Trying to line up a board to engrave side A then engrave and cut side B is almost impossible to get level.  Instead, engrave and cut on side A, go steal a dental pick from the electronics bin, flip your object over in place, then engrave side B
* Blue painters tape or masking tape is your friend. Even if you don't need it to cover your surface to prevent burn, after you've engraved side B, sticking a strip of tap across your cutout parts and the board/plastic will let you pick up most, if not all, the pieces at once off the bed.
