# Consew 230 Industrial Sewing Machine

This is the green industrial table mounted sewing machine located in the craft room.  It should be plugged into the far  wall from the doorway.  The switch for the motor is on the right hand side under the table.  There will be a audibly noticeable hum if the motor is plugged in and is turned on.
