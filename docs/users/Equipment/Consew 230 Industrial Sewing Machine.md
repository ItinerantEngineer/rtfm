# Consew 230 Industrial Sewing Machine

This is the green industrial table mounted sewing machine located in the craft room.  It should be plugged into the far  wall from the doorway.  The switch for the motor is on the right hand side under the table.  There will be a audibly noticeable hum if the motor is plugged in and is turned on.

## Winding the Bobbin
This machine has a separate bobbin winding mechanism to the right of the machine that is threaded differently from threading the machine.  The thread stand has a place for two cones so if you have a second cone of the color you are using, you can leave the machine threaded and thread the bobbin winder with the other one.  Otherwise, you will have to remove the thread from the machine, and wind the bobbin first, then re-thread the machine.

Seat the thread between the plates, and feed up through the hole.
