# Unifi VM

We have a container running on the c220 with an install of  the UniFi software per [their install steps](https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/220066768-UniFi-How-to-Install-Update-via-APT-on-Debian-or-Ubuntu).  This allows us to controll the UniFi APs we have in the shop.

The container is located at [https://10.0.40.55:8443](https://10.0.40.55:8443). You'll need to be on the shop LAN to access it.
